                    <pre  id = 'p1'><h1>Deforestation</h1>
Each year 6 million trees are needed to fuel Greece's paper consumption and more so worldwide 15 billion trees each year are used to make paper. Estimates say the global tree count has fallen by 46% since the beginning of human civilization. This massive loss affects everything but most importantly our climate and the biodiversity of the planet</pre>

                    <pre  id = 'p2'><h1>Waste and pollution</h1>
The agricultural sector throws away secondary products, rich in Bio-energy en-mass. These materials could be applied to better causes but the agricultureal sector sees them as a burden rather than an asset. This problem isn't unique to the producers, one third of all food produced is lost or wasted. Around 1.3 billion tonnes of food costing close to $940 billion each year are wasted. Up to 10% of global greenhouse gases comes from food that is produced, but not eaten.</pre>

Bio-paper is paper made from micro-organisms processing sugars
We cultivate the organism
feed it sugars that would have otherwise gone to waste
and make pulp, Bio-paper.
Once cleaned Bio-paper can make a sheet of paper exactly the same as a trees pulp would have</pre></pre>

                            This is because, thought the number of trees worldwide has grown the ammount of effective trees for creating paper has decreased. All the new trees are a result of efforts to fight climate change and the resulting trees are too young for harvesting, thus, the supply is becoming all the more scarce

                            This works to illustrate how much deforestation actually affects us, and that the efforts to fight it, though great, are not really a solution as much as they are a temporary fix. The real way to solve this crysis is to stop deforestation completly
