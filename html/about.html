                    <div class = 'lorem'><h1>About us</h1><br>EnRise is an emerging biotech startup that leverages scientific knowledge to enhance
human life, environmental sustainability, and economic growth. We are currently focused on
creating sustainable alternatives to traditional paper products. Our flagship product, biopaper, is the world's first paper made entirely through microbial fermentation of industrial
waste, eliminating the need to cut down any trees.<br>
<br>
<h1>Scientific background</h1><br>
The ability of bacteria to produce cellulose has been known since 1886, when A. J. Brown
discovered it. Despite being the subject of academic research, it has had limited industrial
applications, mainly as a food additive (nata de coco). Since cellulose is the primary
material extracted from wood for paper pulp, we thought of using bacterial cellulose for
paper production.
George, (founder of EnRise) who originally came up with this idea, set up a small lab in
his living room and began experimenting. After three months, he successfully made his first
bio-paper. He then continued his work at the National and Kapodistrian University of
Athens.
Î¤oday, we can produce the same amount of bio-paper that initially took months, in just one
day. As a result once we achieve economies of scale combined with circular economy
practises we will be able to produce paper with a much lower cost than traditional wood
paper industries.
